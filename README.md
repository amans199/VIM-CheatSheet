# VIM-CheatSheet
This is a set of most used vim's commands and shortcuts ... 
>Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.



## open a text file inside a folder
1. Navigate to the folder using `cd`.
```
cd laragon/www/some_project/
```
2. then open any file using `vim` + the name of this file.
```
vim README.md
```
## close the vim editor
*you probably won't be able to close the vim editor if it is your first time, we all have been there.*

1. click on the colon `:`
2. write `:q!`

`:q!` => close without saving any changes.

`:wq` => close after saving all changes.
